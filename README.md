# Cropbox-Garlic

Cropbox-Garlic is a garlic simulation model developed by a research group from the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, University of Washington.

The developers are: <br>
Soo-Hyung Kim, Kyungdahm Yun, and Jennifer Hsiao from the University of Washington <br>


Cropbox-Garlic is a mechanistic model that captures growth, development and yield of hardneck garlic _(Allium sativum)_. The model is written in C++, and is executable in a Windows or MacOS environment. Model simulations require a weather file that include hourly inputs of: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and solar raiation. Users can also provide additional details of management practices and cultivar information to customize the initial state of the simulation.

The model manual is included in the repository (manual_v0.1.10.pdf) and the sample/ folder includes weather data (2013.wea) and crop (crop.ini) initial files for one test case. This model is also available from Zenodo repository at: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2598781>
